Welcome to my sandbox. This is React app was created in a day for Ideo to showcase some of the experimental code that I have worked on in the past year. The site is embarssingly crude and I am by no means an expert coder but as a designer, I believe it is important to make sure that what I dream up is achievable. Many a times the limitiations of the technology drives design.
